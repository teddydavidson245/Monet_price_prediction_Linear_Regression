# Monet_price_prediction_Linear_Regression

### Background
According to Wikipedia, Oscar-Claude Monet was a French painter and founder of the impressionist painting who is seen as a key precursor to modernism (see “Claude Monet,” 2022). He is a world-renown painter and, therefore, his paintings are usually sold for a lot of money. The current task is to try and determine predictors for the price of a Monet painting.
### Data Dictionary
•	Price: the price of a Monet painting
•	Height: height of a Monet painting
•	Width: width of a Monet painting
•	House: whether the painting is of a house or not.
•	Signed: whether the painting is signed by the painter or not
•	Picture: number of pictures of the painting.
### Objective 
Task 1. Create at least two simple linear regression models, each of them has one different independent variable (you may transform the raw independent variable into different formats, such as to conduct a logarithmic transformation or combine two variables into a new variable such as Size = width * height). You may consider one variable as Size, and another one as Width. Create a scatter plot for showing the relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable for each model and showing the linear regression line in the same plot. Calculate the error of the prediction with test data. 
Task 2. Create a multivariate linear regression model. You may need to consider the normalization of the raw data. Calculate the error of the prediction with test data.
